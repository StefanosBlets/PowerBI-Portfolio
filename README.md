# 🌍 Global Energy & CO₂ Emissions (2000–2023)

This Power BI report analyzes global trends in energy consumption and carbon emissions between 2000 and 2023, using open datasets from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions) and the [Global Carbon Project](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/).

The goal of this project is to provide interactive and insightful visualizations on how energy use and CO₂ emissions have evolved globally, per capita, and relative to economic performance.

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- **CO₂ Emissions per Capita vs Energy per Capita (2000–2023)**
- **Global GDP per CO₂ Efficiency** (GDP per tonne of CO₂)
- **Year-over-Year % Change in CO₂ Emissions per Capita**
- **Total Population vs Energy/CO₂ per Capita**
- **Global CO₂ and Energy Trends (Cards + Time Series)**
- **Regional CO₂ Efficiency Comparisons**
- **Summary & Insights page** for storytelling

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- 🌱 Countries like **Germany, UK, and Japan** showed strong improvements in CO₂ per GDP efficiency, proving that economic growth can be decoupled from emissions.
- 📉 A dramatic **drop in both energy use and emissions occurred in 2020**, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the link between human activity and environmental impact.
- 📈 In contrast, **emerging economies** (e.g., China, India) are now responsible for nearly **50% of global CO₂ emissions**, despite ongoing efficiency efforts.
- 🔁 Global **CO₂/GDP efficiency has been improving** consistently over the last two decades.
